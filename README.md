# Rimhammer40k_Imperium
I made this for myself.\
All i did is i took the default (or modded) defs and tweaked it to work with some content from original mod. So all the rights reserved by everyone but me.\
Making other races or subhumans is beyond my intelectual level.

Currently working:\
Cadian armor,\
Some of the lasguns,\
Most of the kinetic weapons,\
All of the astartes armors (I used the hulk bodytype vesion of textures for all other bodytypes),\
Wheeled and tarantula turrets,\
Generators and battory,\
Ceramite (refining is moved to smelter tho).

Forks, pull requests, modding advices (bodytype apparel locking, bodytype creation with genes in mind especialy), and whines about lore mistakes are welcomed.

English is not my main language as you can see.
